Agent Answers:

[ResearchAgent] (conf=0.80)
Transformers balance computational efficiency with performance through strategic trade-offs in 2023, including model scaling, attention mechanisms, and precision optimization.

- Larger models boost accuracy but increase compute; pruning/quantization reduces size without significant accuracy loss

[AnalysisAgent] (conf=0.80)
Transformers optimize efficiency via model scaling, attention mechanisms, and precision adjustments, with trade-offs between accuracy and compute cost.

- Larger models improve accuracy but escalate compute requirements
- Pruning and quantization reduce model size while maintaining acceptable accuracy
- Efficient attention mechanisms (e.g., sparse attention) minimize computational overhead
- Mixed-precision training cuts memory usage without major accuracy trade-offs
- Trade-offs between model complexity and inference speed impact real-world deployment
