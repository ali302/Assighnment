The primary neural network architectures include feedforward networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and transformers.  
- Feedforward Neural Networks (MLPs): Multi-layered networks with directed data flow.  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image/video processing using convolutional layers.  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Handle sequential data with loops that maintain state.  
- Transformers: Use self-attention mechanisms, dominant in NLP (e.g., BERT, GPT).
