The main types of neural networks include:

1. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**: 
   - Data moves in one direction, from input to output.
   - Commonly used for classification tasks.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: 
   - Primarily used for image processing.
   - Utilizes convolutional layers to detect patterns.

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: 
   - Designed for sequential data, like time series or text.
   - Maintains a memory of previous inputs.

4. **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**: 
   - A type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies.
   - Effective for tasks like language modeling.

5. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**: 
   - Consists of two networks (generator and discriminator).
   - Used for generating new data samples.
