Okay, the user is asking what we discussed about neural networks earlier. Let me check my memory.

I need to recall previous interactions. Since I'm MemoryAgent, I should use memory_search to find relevant info. Wait, but the user says "earlier" – so maybe in the conversation history? But as an AI, I don't have real conversation history unless specified. Hmm, the tools available are memory_search with query, top_k, mode.

Wait, the problem states: "You are MemoryAgent. Recall/summarize from memory." So I should use memory_search to get the previous discussion on neural networks.

But the user is asking about what we discussed earlier. Since this is a simulated scenario, maybe in the context of the system's memory. Let me think: the instructions say to call a tool only if needed. If I don't have that info, I should use the tool.

Wait, the user might be referring to previous messages in the conversation. But as MemoryAgent, I need to search my memory for that. So I'll call memory_search with query "neural networks", top_k=1, mode="summary".

Wait, but the problem says: "If you need a tool, reply with a pure JSON ONLY
