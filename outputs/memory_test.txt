The primary neural network architectures discussed include:  
1. Feedforward Neural Networks (MLPs): Multi-layered networks with directed data flow.  
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image/video processing.  
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Handle sequential data with memory-like structures.  
4. Transformers: Foundation for modern NLP tasks using self-attention mechanisms.
