Okay, the user wants me to compare two machine learning approaches and recommend which is better for their use case. But wait, they didn't specify what the two approaches are or what their use case actually is. Hmm, that's a problem.

Looking at the tools I have: calculator and memory_search. The calculator can do math expressions, but without numbers to compare, that's not helpful here. Memory_search could look up information about ML approaches, but I need to know which two they're referring to. 

The user didn't provide any specific details about the models or their use case. So I can't really compute or compare anything without that info. My job is to be precise and only call tools when needed. Since I don't have enough context here, I shouldn't make up examples or assume. 

I should respond with a TL;DR saying I need more details. The instructions say to start with one sentence, then bullets. But since the user didn't specify the options or use case, the answer has to be that I can't proceed without that info. 

Wait, the decision policy says call a tool ONLY if required to compute/lookup. Here, I don't have enough info to call any tool. So I should just state that
