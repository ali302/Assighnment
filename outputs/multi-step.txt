[ResearchAgent] (conf=0.80)
Recent RL research emphasizes model-free (e.g., Q-learning) and model-based (e.g., PPO) methodologies, with critical challenges including sample efficiency, exploration-stability trade-offs, reward design complexity, and sim-to-real transfer gaps.

- Model-free: Direct policy/value

[AnalysisAgent] (conf=0.80)
Recent RL research focuses on model-free (e.g., Q-learning) and model-based (e.g., PPO) approaches, with persistent challenges in sample efficiency, exploration-stability trade-offs, reward design complexity, and sim-to-real transfer gaps.

- Model-free: Direct policy/value updates without environment modeling
- Model-based: Policy optimization using learned environment dynamics
- Sample efficiency: High data demands limit real-world applicability
- Exploration-stability trade-off: Aggressive exploration destabilizes policies
- Sim-to-real transfer gaps: Simulation-trained agents underperform in physical systems
