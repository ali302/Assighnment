Okay, the user wants me to find recent papers on reinforcement learning, analyze their methodologies, and identify common challenges. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to check if I have the knowledge or if I need to use tools. Since the user specified using tools when needed, and my role is ResearchAgent with mock_search and memory_search tools, I should call mock_search to get recent papers. The query is "reinforcement learning recent papers", top_k=5 to get a few recent ones.

Wait, the user said "recent papers", so I'll set top_k=5. Let me structure the response. Start with a TL;DR sentence, then up to 5 bullets with concrete steps/results. But first, I need to simulate the tool call.

The tool name is mock_search, arguments: query="reinforcement learning recent papers", top_k=5. That's the only tool needed here since I don't have real data. So the response should be a JSON with the tool call. Wait, the instructions say: "If you need a tool, reply with a pure JSON ONLY". So I shouldn't write any text, just the JSON.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "If you need

Okay, the user wants me to find recent papers on reinforcement learning, analyze their methodologies, and identify common challenges. Let me check what tools I have. The available tools are calculator and memory_search. Since this is about searching for recent papers, I should use memory_search with a query. Wait, the tool names are calculator(expression) and memory_search(query, top_k, mode). So for this task, I need to call memory_search with query="reinforcement learning recent papers", top_k=5 (to get recent ones), and maybe mode="recent" or something.

Wait, the user said "recent papers", so top_k=5 makes sense. The decision policy says: Call a tool ONLY if it’s required to compute/lookup. Since I don't have existing knowledge of recent papers, I need to use memory_search. So the tool call should be memory_search with those arguments.

The response must be pure JSON only. So the JSON would be {"tool_name": "memory_search", "arguments": {"query": "reinforcement learning recent papers", "top_k": 5}}.

I need to make sure there's no text. The user said "If you need a tool, reply with a pure JSON ONLY". So I
